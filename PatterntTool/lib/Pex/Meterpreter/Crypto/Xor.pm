# Descrip:
#
#      This module provides an xor implementation that can be used to
#      encrypt the communication channel between the client and server.
#
#      Obviously this shouldn't be considered secure (hell...the key
#      is transmitted in plain text to the server).  It does, however, 
#      obfuscate plaintext and help to bypass IDS if necessary.
